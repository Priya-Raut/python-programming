# Project Proposal

### **Tech Stack: Python**
### **Team Number: 1**
### **Project Domain: Education**
### **Project Name: Animated Visualization of Data Structures and Algorithms**

# Project Overview

Our idea is to write a python script which would visualize various Algorithms and Data  Structures, like tree formation, reversing a linked list, finding a single source shortest path, and many more using animation.

The key  idea here is to convert what we learn in theory to an animated visualization.
