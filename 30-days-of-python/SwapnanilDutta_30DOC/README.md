# 30 Days of Code
These are the programs given in the 30 Days of Code challenge on Hackerrank. Each program has a separate file and also contains part of the questions. I have written all the programs in Python3.

### [**Day 0 :**](/30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D0-Hello-World.py) 
```
Just a simple "Hello World" program to display an input string. This was just a warm-up program before the actual challenges.
```
### [**Day 1 :**](/30-days-of-python/SwapnanilDutta_30DOC/D1-Data-Types.py) 
```
A simple program to accept and display a sum of two numbers in integer and double types and also string concatenation with an input string. This was the first challenge and it was just to test out the functionality of the code.
